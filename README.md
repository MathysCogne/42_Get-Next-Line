## Description

Get Next Line (GNL) is a project to read a line from a file descriptor, returning it one line at a time.

The primary goal is to create a function that efficiently reads and returns lines from a file or standard input without memory leaks.

</br>

## Usage
To use the `get_next_line` function in your project, include the header file and call the function with a file descriptor:

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"

int	main(void)
{
	int		fd;
	char	*line;

	fd = open("your_file.txt", O_RDONLY);

	while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL)
	{
		printf("%s\n", line);
		free(line);
	}
	close(fd);
	return (0);
}

```
